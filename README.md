## About:

This is a simple machine learning library written in Python 3.8 for the sake of both learning and simple use-cases where neural network training might be beneficial. I created this mostly for my own usage, but because this was created during the process of learning how neural networks/machine learning works, I thought it would be a good idea to share the source code to whoever wants to see it.

The comments in the code reflect my learning process, with all the different pieces split up into their own individual Python scripts (for example, all activation functions are defined in the 'activations.py' file).

I decided to call this library Sensei, because sensei is another word for teacher which also kind of sounds like Tensor.

Feel free to use this code or any variation of this code to do whatever you want with. I don't claim that any of the code here is perfect, but it works well enough or the few cases I've tested it with and having the source code can be useful for exploring why things work the way they do.
