## About:

This is a simple machine learning library written in Python 3.8 for the sake of both learning and simple use-cases where neural network training might be beneficial. I created this mostly for my own usage, but because this was created during the process of learning how neural networks/machine learning works, I thought it would be a good idea to share the source code to whoever wants to see it. 

Everything is commented as I learned it, all the different pieces are split up into their own individual Python scripts (for example, all activation functions are defined in the 'activations.py' file). 

I decided to call this library Sensei, because sensei is another word for teacher which also kind of sounds like Tensor.
